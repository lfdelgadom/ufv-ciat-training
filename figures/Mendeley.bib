It is made available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license. Accurate QTL mapping in outcrossing species requires software programs which consider genetic features of these populations, such as markers with different segregation patterns and different level of information. Although the available mapping procedures to date allow inferring QTL position and effects, they are mostly not based on multilocus genetic maps. Having a QTL analysis based in such maps is crucial since they allow informative markers to propagate their information to less informative intervals of the map. We developed fullsibQTL, a novel and freely available R package to perform composite interval QTL mapping considering outcrossing populations and markers with different segregation patterns. It allows to estimate QTL position, effects, segregation patterns, and linkage phase with flanking markers. Additionally, several statistical and graphical tools are implemented, for straightforward analysis and interpretations. fullsibQTL is an R open source package with C and R source code (GPLv3). It is multiplatform and can be installed from https://github.com/augusto-garcia/fullsibQTL.},

abstract = {With the advent of new molecular marker technologies, it is now feasible to initiate genome projects for outcrossing plant species, which have not received much attention in genetic research, despite their great agricultural and environmental value. Because outcrossing species typically have heterogeneous genomes, data structure for molecular markers representing an entire genome is complex: some markers may have more alleles than others, some markers are codominant whereas others are dominant, and some markers are heterozygous in one parent but fixed in the other parent whereas the opposite can be true for other markers. A major difficulty in analyzing these different types of marker at the same time arises from uncertainty about parental linkage phases over markers. In this paper, we present a general maximum-likelihood-based algorithm for simultaneously estimating linkage and linkage phases for a mixed set of different marker types containing fully informative markers (segregating 1:1:1:1) and partially informative markers (or missing markers, segregating 1:2:1, 3:1, and 1:1) in a full-sib family derived from two outbred parent plants. The characterization of linkage phases is based on the posterior probability distribution of the assignment of alternative alleles at given markers to two homologous chromosomes of each parent, conditional on the observed phenotypes of the markers. Two- and multi-point analyses are performed to estimate the recombination fraction and determine the most likely linkage phase between different types of markers. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the statistical properties of the model for characterizing the linkage phase between markers.},

abstract = {Most current linkage analyses assume identical fractions of meiotic recombination between homologous marker loci of the two sexes. This assumption is not realistic, because considerable sex-related differences have been observed in recombination fraction. In this paper, a general EM-based algorithm is presented to estimate sex-specific recombination fractions for a mixed set of molecular markers segregating differently in a full-sib family derived from two heterozygous parents. The asymptotic variances of the estimates of linkage specifically for each of the parents are evaluated using a numerical analysis based on information functions. This approach will have important implications for precise gene mapping based on sex-specific linkage maps.},
